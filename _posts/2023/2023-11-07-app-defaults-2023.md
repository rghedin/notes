Everyone ([it seems](https://defaults.rknight.me)) is posting their app defaults lists, so I thought to join the party as well.

* Mail Client: Mail.app
* Mail Server: Fastmail and Zoho Mail
* Notes: Simplenote and *.txt files
* To-Do: Apple Reminders
* Photo Management: iCloud Photos
* Calendar: Apple Calendar
* Cloud File Storage: iCloud
* RSS: Miniflux @ NetNewsWire
* Browser: Safari
* Chat: Signal, Element X (Matrix), Telegram, and WhatsApp
* Bookmarks: Linkding
* Read It Later: Instapaper

There are a lot of Apple apps and services, a side effect of using macOS and iOS as main OSs. I hope to improve on that someday.
