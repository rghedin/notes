This Friday (17<sup>th</sup>), the [Read.cv](https://read.cv) platform [announced](https://read.cv/a-new-chapter) that it was acquired by Perplexity, an AI startup, and it will cease operations.

Read.cv had a social network focused on design called [Posts](https://posts.cv). In June 2024, [I wrote about it](https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2024/posts-cv-last-good-vibes-social-media/). I called it “the last good vibes social media.” By that logic, “good vibes social media” has come to an end.

Coincidence or bad omen, the announcement coincided with my opinion that the only way to shield a social platform (any venture, in reality) from eccentric billionaires and mega-corporations is [to make its sale impossible](https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2025/bluesky-free-our-feeds-mastodon/).

In this context, Mastodon and other applications based on the ActivityPub protocol are the only viable solution we have today.
