[Omnivore](https://omnivore.app), the popular free read-it-later app, has been acquired by ElevenLabs, an AI startup focused on audio.

*Update (15h30 UTC -3): In a new message, Omnivore said its app will be discontinued on November 15<sup>th</sup> and all user data will be deleted. ([Screenshot](/assets/2024/omnivore-adquired-elevenlabs/omnivore-shutdown.png)).*

The announcement hasn't been made official yet. Jackson Harper, founder of Omnivore, gave users a heads-up via its newsletter. ([Screenshot](/assets/2024/omnivore-adquired-elevenlabs/email-omnivore-elevenlabs.png).)

In the message, Jackson mentions that the focus is now “on expanding [ElevenReader](https://elevenlabs.io/text-reader), a powerful listening and reading app that lets you listen to any text with ultra-realistic AI voices”.

He assures that “the Omnivore code base will remain 100% open-source for all developers,” and that “ElevenLabs has been truly committed to ensuring the developer community can continue to build upon the foundation we’ve built as a preferred read-it-later service”.

So, does this mean Jackson is stepping away from the Omnivore project and that it is now adrift?
