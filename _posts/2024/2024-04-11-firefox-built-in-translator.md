Mozilla is testing the translation of selected text in Firefox. For now, [as *Omg! Ubuntu* shows](https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/04/firefox-translate-selected-text-feature), it's only available in experimental versions of the browser.

It's a fantastic feature, similar to what Apple introduced in macOS 12 Monterey in 2021. By the nature of what I do, I deal with lots of texts in English throughout the day. (My mother tongue is Portuguese.) Having a decent translator [just a click from the mouse away](https://support.apple.com/pt-br/guide/mac-help/mchldd8b3c15/mac), anywhere in the system, is a super power that I didn't know I needed.

Recently, I tried to use only Linux (and Firefox as the main browser) for a week. I resorted to [the DeepL extension](https://www.deepl.com/pt-BR/firefox-extension), which offers a similar feature, although a little unstable. Having a translation tool built into the browser is probably better.

The Firefox solution is limited to Firefox/browser. It's a shame, but better than nothing.
