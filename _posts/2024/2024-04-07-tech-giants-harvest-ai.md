The *New York Times* published [a bombshell report](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/06/technology/tech-giants-harvest-data-artificial-intelligence.html) on how, behind the scenes, large AI companies find a (sometimes illegal) way to harvest content to train their large language models, the basis of generative AI.

The funniest part is Google turning a blind eye to OpenAI transcribing 1 million hours (!) of YouTube videos to power GPT-4 because Google itself was doing the same for Gemini. (The practice violates the terms of use of YouTube.)

It gets better. Two days earlier, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan [told *Bloomberg*](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-04/youtube-says-openai-training-sora-with-its-videos-would-break-the-rules) that the use of videos by OpenAI to train Sora, its astonishing AI video generator, would be against the platform's terms of use.
