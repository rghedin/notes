We notice that Twitter (or X), which is now [blocked here in Brazil](https://nucleo.jor.br/english/2024-08-30-brazilian-justice-orders-complete-block-of-x-in-brazil/), is an addiction when people come to other social networks and are shocked by the bare minimum of human decency — like the absence of scam and betting ads and extremist accounts paying for visibility, along with decent moderation tools, etc.

I joke that Twitter is a digital drug, but honestly, it’s not really a joke.
