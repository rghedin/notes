Sam Altman wrote a blog post titled [“The Intelligence Age,”](https://ia.samaltman.com/) which I imagine wasn't reviewed by OpenAI's marketing team. Not just because it's published on a domain with Altman's name, but more because it's a mediocre piece, so bad and filled with grand, empty, and/or unverifiable promises that I doubt even ChatGPT could generate it.

“It is possible that we will have superintelligence in a few thousand days (!),” Altman writes. “A few thousand days” means a good few of years during which he can keep deceiving everyone with an AI that is far from delivering on its promises. “It may take longer, but I’m confident we’ll get there.” Sure, it may take a bit longer, but just sit tight and we’ll get there. Someday. Maybe. We’ll keep in touch.

I’ll spare you from reading that because the over a thousand words can be summed up in one line: “AI will be revolutionary soon, gimme more money.”

How is it possible that so many smart people don’t realize that the biggest “hallucination” produced by AI was this Sam Altman?
