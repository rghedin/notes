In [this Apple Intelligence ad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0BXZhdDqZM), we see a dad getting some humble gifts from his two daughters, while mom's in the kitchen, freaking out because she forgot hubby's birthday and/or buying him a gift.

Mom grabs her iPhone with Apple Intelligence and asks the AI to whip up a video of dad's memories with the kids. In the end, she leaves the phone with the three of them on the couch, totally mesmerized over this artificial masterpiece, while she struts back to whatever she was doing, giving us a look like we're in on her little scheme.

Apple — which has been [dropping the ball with commercials](https://notes.ghed.in/posts/2022/apples-marketing-terrorism/) for a while now — is selling AI as a get-out-of-jail-free card for any external demands, including the emotional ones. It's tech so powerful it can distract your loved ones with some generic content you didn't even bother to check.

No wonder generative AI is such a hit with execs and employees at big companies — folks who deal with tons of crappy texts that nobody reads unless they have to (if they read them at all).

Apple Intelligence's hook takes this crazy dynamic to the deepest levels of affection — in this case, the heart of a family. The daughters' lame but heartfelt gifts suddenly become just lame. Intention doesn't matter. Apple's ideal customer is heartless.

The scene isn't weird if you look at it from a corporate angle that companies like Apple usually try to hide behind “branding,” “storytelling,” and other marketing manipulation tricks. The bottom line is to sell.

What's shocking is how blatant this intention is. And also the fact that a petty character is the star of the commercial, the one we're supposed to identify with and make us want to use Apple's AI.

Rob Horning, in [his analysis of the ad](https://robhorning.substack.com/p/the-thought-doesnt-count), pins the mom's behavior on a widespread selfishness, amped up by convenience appeals from companies like Apple and a full-on display of hyper-individualization. While he tackles the ad in the context of US elections, the reflection goes beyond borders; it's universal.

If you're still not convinced of Apple's tastelessness, try putting yourself in the dad's or daughters' shoes, and imagine a sequel where they catch mom red-handed, getting the AI to make the video right there, with a grumpy look on her face. Awkward, to say the least.

My beef with generative AI, which I've harped on endlessly since its first public appearance, comes from one of those “other” places. In my case, as someone who has and depends on a website, one of many being sucked dry and tossed aside by AI companies without a second thought or any compensation.

A few days back, I redeemed a coupon from my internet provider that gave me a free year of Perplexity Pro, from the startup of the same name that's trying to be [the “Google of the AI era,”](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187405/perplexity-ai-twitter-lie-plagiarism) caught [breaking websites' explicit instructions](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/27/24187405/perplexity-ai-twitter-lie-plagiarism) not to scrape their content.

I'll admit, the experience is good. Generative AIs are great for answering trivial questions, something that's become impossible on Google, where we've gotten used to doing this kind of search for the past 20 years, thanks to Google's misguided incentives that led to an infestation of low-quality sites — the proverbial shot in the foot.

It's likely that other AI products and services deliver pleasant experiences like this for users, though it's not a given. The question is whether those on the receiving end or impacted somehow by AI-generated content are having the same good experience.

We can't all be the clever (and slightly psychopathic) mom from the Apple commercial. Who will be the dad and daughters, made fools of by someone unsuspecting, who (in theory) wants the best for us?
