[Fastmail has changed its plans](https://www.fastmail.com/blog/new-family-plans-and-pricing/) and now charges in 20 different currencies instead of only USD. The new plans are aimed at “individuals and families”, and include one, two or even six users. The old ones continue to exist, but now in a “business” category.

The old standard plan now offers 50 GB of storage instead of 30 GB, and the basic one bumps from 2 to 5 GB. Those who are already customers will be migrated to the new plans and local values later this year, but already enjoy the extra storage.
