Matt Mullenweg, co-founder of WordPress and founder and CEO of Automattic, which owns WordPress.com, made some strong criticisms of WP Engine, a WordPress-focused hosting company, during his closing speech of WordCamp&nbsp;US. He told the audience to ditch WP Engine if they were using it. Notably, WP Engine was a sponsor of the event.

***Update 2 (23/9, 18h17 UTC -3):** WP Engine is suing Matt, WordPress, and Automattic, per Matt himself [in this Reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fn3mjr/matt_mullenweg_needs_to_step_down_from/lokzvec/).*

***Update 3 (24/9, 7h11 UTC -3):** WP Engine [cease and desist letter](https://wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Cease-and-Desist-Letter-to-Automattic-and-Request-to-Preserve-Documents-Sent.pdf) (PDF) to Automattic/Matt Mullenweg.*

***Update 4 (24/9, 7h28 UTC -3):** On Reddit, [Matt himself confirmed](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/1fnz0h6/cease_desist_letter_from_wp_engine_was_made_public/lon9wsg/) he asked for 8% of WP Revenue or else.*

***Update 5 (24/9, 19h30 UTC -3):** On July, the WordPress Foundation filed to trademark [“managed WordPress”](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98646183&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch) and [“hosted WordPress”](https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98646185&caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&caseType=DEFAULT&searchType=statusSearch) in the US. Why WordPress Foundation, which doesn't host anything, wants to trademark these terms is beyond me. Also, their site (Matt?) updated [its trademark policy](https://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/) to retroactively disincentive the “WP” usage, citing WP&nbsp;Engine as an example.*

On Saturday (21st), Matt published a more intense and fiery version of his rant against WP Engine [on the WordPress.org blog](https://wordpress.org/news/2024/09/wp-engine/), the FOSS project he leads as WordPress Foundation chairman.

Matt called WP Engine “a cancer to WordPress” and claimed that what they offer isn’t really WordPress because they disable post revisions by default. He argued that this is damaging to the WordPress brand because WP Engine’s modifications create confusion. The first paragraph of his post reads:

>“It has to be said and repeated: WP Engine is not WordPress. My own mother was confused and thought WP Engine was an official thing. Their branding, marketing, advertising, and entire promise to customers is that they’re giving you WordPress, but they’re not. And they’re profiting off of the confusion.”

WP Engine was acquired by a private equity firm, Silver Lake. According to Matt's post, “they break the trust and sanctity of our software’s promise to users to save themselves money so they can extract more profits from you”. Somehow, changing a default WordPress config documented and supported officially violates its “sanctity”.

What I find deeply ironic in this situation is his accusation that WP Engine “confused even his own mother,” while he’s the owner of Automattic, which has a hosting service literally called WordPress.com, distinct from the FOSS project WordPress.org — an intentional yet obvious confusion that everyone who interacts with WordPress struggles to understand and has benefited Automattic immensely since ever.

Last year, Matt leveraged the FOSS project and his for-profit endeavor resemblance (and his position in both) to [redirect web searches pointed at WordPress.org plugin directory to a mirror hosted in WordPress.com](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2023/10/problem-wordpress-positioning-not-plugins/). No ranting was posted at WordPress.org towards this unethical, unacceptable inside plot after they reversed course due to the community heavy criticism.

Additionally, it’s also ironic (hypocritical, I’d say) for him to complain about the lack of post revisions as something that undermines WordPress, while Automattic offers WordPress without access to plugins and all themes in its basic hosting plans, and makes Jetpack, a Trojan horse to upsell features (even the basics, [like… stats](https://jetpack.com/blog/updates-to-jetpack-stats-for-commercial-sites/)), mandatory for all users.

I really like WordPress, as I’ve stated many times, but Matt has become an irresponsible and damaging actor. He urgently needs to step down from WordPress.org leadership, or he risks undermining WordPress' popularity and driving the community away.

Disclaimer: I'm a WordPress user and WordPress.com paying customer, and overall happy with the service, except for Jetpack and all the gymnastics I need to perform to get rid of those pesky blocks/Gutenberg crappy.
