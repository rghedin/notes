The beauty of free and open source software (FOSS) is the possibilities that it opens up for better futures to abandoned or spoiled projects.

It happened recently with Simple Mobile Tools for Android. After the apps creator [sold them](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/General-Discussion/issues/241) to a shady company, someone [forked the code](https://github.com/FossifyOrg) to continue the development oriented to the original intentions.

Two other examples of which I learned from [F-Droid's latest weekly report](https://f-droid.org/en/2024/04/11/twif.html).

Geometric Weather, a weather forecast app, stopped being developed and was retired from the store in mid-March, already with the promise that a fork was on the way.

It has arrived! It's called [Breezy Weather](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.breezyweather/) and has four distinct versions, from the most purist (with also free data sources) to the traditional. In the project repository, there is [an instructions page](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather/blob/main/INSTALL.md) about these versions.

The other app, the Android keyboard OpenBoard, had been abandoned for two years. This is far from ideal, but less bad that a group has adopted the project and now relaunched it with another name and a series of improvements and bug fixes. It's called [HeliBoard](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/helium314.keyboard/).
