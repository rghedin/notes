Even I, who prefer paper books, can’t deny the perks of e-readers like the Kindle—and, well, just the Kindle. In Brazil, you can pick any e-reader you want, as long as it’s a Kindle. (Kobo, Boox, and other brands don't sell their devices here.)

Buying an Amazon device is basically making a deal with the devil, I mean, with Jeff Bezos, or just with Amazon itself. Sure, you can load it up with books and documents not bought from Amazon, but those files still have to go through their servers.

Or do they?

Right before Black Friday 2023, I asked readers on my pt_BR website if it was possible to use a Kindle without linking it to an Amazon account. After reading some positive replies, I took the plunge and bought the then-latest basic model, the 11<sup>th</sup> generation.

I can confirm that, yes, you can use a Kindle without tying it to Amazon. In fact, you can keep it offline — mine has been offline for eight months since I unboxed it and it’s doing just fine.

In this offline mode, you lose some features, like that convenient wireless file transfer through Amazon’s servers via email.

But honestly, I was surprised at how functional an offline Kindle is. Among other things I thought were impossible, I can take notes, highlight text, transfer books I bought from Amazon to it, and even update its firmware.

Updating the firmware isn’t really necessary, especially if you plan to keep it away from the internet. I did it just to see if it worked, so I can’t give you all the details.

As far as I remember, you first need to download the installer for the new version [from Amazon website](https://arcus-www.amazon.com.br/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GKMQC26VQQMM8XSW). Then, you transfer it to the Kindle’s memory using the USB cable that comes in the box. This is where I get a bit fuzzy: I can’t remember how to start the update. If anyone has done this and remembers, please let me know.

Transferring books involves a must-have software — whether your Kindle is connected to Amazon or not — called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/).

Don’t let the ugly UI scare you off. Once you get past that awful first impression, Calibre turns out to be a pretty great app.

When you install it, you specify your e-reader model, and it makes the necessary adjustments. After that, just connect your Kindle to the computer with the USB cable and start managing your digital books.

You can download your Amazon books [here](https://arcus-www.amazon.com.br/hz/mycd/digital-console/contentlist/booksAll/dateDsc/) — click on the `More Actions` button, then `Download and Transfer via USB`. Just drag them into Calibre, and the app will break Amazon’s copy protection, making them ready to transfer to your Kindle.

Books from the other digital store in Brazil, Kobo, also need their protection removed. Getting those `*.epub` files can be a hassle and involves downloading [Adobe Digital Editions](https://www.adobe.com/br/solutions/ebook/digital-editions.html), which is a nightmare of an app, and signing up for a free Adobe account if you don’t already have one. But it works!

After that, it’s just… well, reading. It’s almost poetic, really, to reduce the Kindle to just reading, no internet, no Amazon snooping around — just me and my books. It makes the experience feel a bit more like reading a paper book.
