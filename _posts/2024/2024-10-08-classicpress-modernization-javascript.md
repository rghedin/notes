ClassicPress is still going strong. After a new fork from WordPress, the project has now taken its own path, and it’s starting to pay off.

On their blog, Tim Kaye is [talking about](https://www.classicpress.net/replacing-thickbox/) the [work being done](https://www.classicpress.net/dragging-dropping-and-sorting/) to modernize some really old JavaScript libraries that are still in use in WordPress. These updates should make the ClassicPress admin panel faster and more touch-friendly.

Sure, WordPress has a huge legacy that makes any changes tough, but I suspect that the focus on the Gutenberg block editor, which has been the standard since 2018, doesn’t leave much room for… details.
