In September 2023, [Google announced](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/podcast-destination-on-youtube-music/) the end of Google Podcasts in favor of YouTube Music. At some point after that, an exact date for the closure appeared: April 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2024.

It turns out that this deadline only applies to the United States. In a post [on the Google forums for podcasters](https://support.google.com/podcast-publishers/thread/264592324?hl=en), dated March 18<sup>th</sup>, a company employee, Cory Peter, explains that Google Podcasts will be discontinuing in the rest of the world on June 24<sup>th</sup>. Those who trust the Google's app to listen to podcasts have almost three months to export their subscriptions to another app.
